# Organizer

_Organizer_ is a personal side project aimed at creating a tool for organizing everyday things. The features, used technologies etc. may change over time.

## Current state

The project is started as an Android App created with flutter and using firebase/firestore for authentication and data storage. The first version contains a work time tracker that can be used to note down working hours and that will then provide statistics and graphs. More features like Todo lists are planned.
